FastText is a word embedding technique developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It is an extension of the popular Word2Vec model that is capable of capturing subword information by representing words as bags of character n-grams

In this repo I trained a fasttext model on a corpus 200,000 of sentences. the results show that words has high similarity with similar words like ***Felafel*** showed high similarity with arab traditional food words such as ***'shwarma', 'tabbouleh','babaganoush'***

The word ***Good*** shows high similarity with positive meaning words such as ***‘amazing’, ‘delicious’, ‘excellent’***
